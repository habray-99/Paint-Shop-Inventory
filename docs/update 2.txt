### **Clarification: WholesalePrice in Products**  

The **`WholesalePrice`** in the `Products` table represents the **base price per unit** of a product (e.g., per liter for paint, per kg for putty) **before any taxes are applied**.  

#### **Key Points:**  
1. **Definition**:  
   - This is the price the shop pays to the supplier (or the cost before markup).  
   - Example:  
     - **4L Paint** may have a `WholesalePrice = 800 NPR` (per unit).  
     - **5Kg Putty** may have a `WholesalePrice = 500 NPR` (per unit).  

2. **How It’s Used**:  
   - **For Tax Calculations**:  
     - Excise (7%) and VAT (13%) are calculated **on top of** the `WholesalePrice`.  
     - Example:  
       ```  
       WholesalePrice = 800 NPR  
       Excise = 800 × 0.07 = 56 NPR  
       VAT = (800 + 56) × 0.13 = 111.28 NPR  
       RetailPrice = 800 + 56 + 111.28 = 967.28 NPR  
       ```  
   - **For FIFO Inventory**:  
     - The `CostPrice` in `InventoryStock` may vary per batch, but **`WholesalePrice` in `Products` is a reference for current pricing**.  
     - Example:  
       - Batch A (May 2024): `CostPrice = 800 NPR`  
       - Batch B (July 2024): `CostPrice = 850 NPR` (due to inflation)  
       - The `Products.WholesalePrice` could be updated to `850 NPR` when Batch B becomes the primary stock.  

3. **When Does It Change?**  
   - Manually updated when **supplier prices change** (not automatically tied to `InventoryStock.CostPrice`).  
   - Used as the default price for **new orders** unless overridden (e.g., discounts).  

4. **Difference from `CostPrice` in InventoryStock**:  
   | Field | Table | Purpose |  
   |-------|-------|---------|  
   | `WholesalePrice` | `Products` | **Current base price** (before taxes) for sales calculations. |  
   | `CostPrice` | `InventoryStock` | **Actual purchase price** of a specific batch (used for FIFO & profit tracking). |  

#### **Example Workflow:**  
1. **Product Setup**:  
   - Admin adds a product:  
     ```  
     ProductID: 101  
     Name: "Premium 4L Paint"  
     WholesalePrice: 800 NPR  
     Category: "Paint"  
     ShadeSlug: "royal-blue"  
     ```  
2. **Restocking**:  
   - New batch arrives with `CostPrice = 820 NPR` (different from `WholesalePrice` due to market changes).  
   - System records in `InventoryStock`:  
     ```  
     BatchID: 202  
     ProductID: 101  
     CostPrice: 820 NPR  
     Quantity: 50  
     PurchaseDateAD: 2024-07-10  
     PurchaseDateBS: 2081-03-25  
     ```  
3. **Selling**:  
   - Customer buys 10 units.  
   - System uses **FIFO** (oldest `CostPrice` first) but applies taxes based on **current `WholesalePrice` (800 NPR)**.  

---

### **Summary**  
- **`WholesalePrice`** = Current base price (before taxes) for sales.  
- **`CostPrice`** = Historical purchase price per batch (for FIFO).  
- Taxes are always calculated from `WholesalePrice`, while profit calculations may use `CostPrice`.
